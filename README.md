### Image processing 
### 1. Description 
We are going to use the steps in the section below to correctly predict the numbers based on the images in the Mnist dataset using machine learning technics

### Task
In this task, we are going to Follow these steps:
- Load the MNIST dataset.Use a library such as scikit-learn to access the dataset (fromsklearn.datasetsimportload_digits)
- Split the data into train and test sets.
   - Add a comment explaining the purpose of the train and test sets.
- Use the Random Forest Classifier built in to scikit-learn to create a classification model. 
- Pick one parameter to tune, and explain why you chose this parameter.
- Select a value for the parameter to use during testing on the test data,and provide a rationale for your choice
- Print the confusion matrix for your Random Forest model on the test set.
- Report which classes the model struggles with the most.
- Report the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. 

    Hint: use average = ”macro” inprecision_score, recall_score and f1_score fromscikit-learn
  
### Tools used

We have used Jupyter notebook in this task as well as python, scikitlearn and all the libraries associated
